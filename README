Notes on the Project 
--------------------
Maven command I used to create the project:

mvn archetype:create -DarchetypeGroupId=org.glassfish.cafe.archetypes -DarchetypeArtifactId=cafe-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -DremoteRepositories=http://download.java.net/maven/2 -DgroupId=my.test -DartifactId=gtranslatedemo -Dversion=0.1-SNAPSHOT

Building the sample.
--------------------
There is a shell script in the project directory called "build". Just execute that.
You need maven 2 and curl in the path.

The build produces cafe-google-translate/gtranslatedemo/target/gtranslatedemo.war, which
can be deployed to sailfin (where sailfin cafe is installed).

Running the demo.
----------------

1. Run the web application in a browser http://localhost:8080/cafe-app/.
   You can set the language of the user in this application.

2. Use SIP Softphones to send and receive messages. The SIP user will receive
   the messages in the language set.
